The Apollo 11 mission was the first manned mission to land on the Moon. Launched by NASA on July 16, 1969, the spacecraft carried astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins. On July 20, 1969, Armstrong became the first human to step onto the lunar surface, followed shortly by Aldrin. The mission was a defining moment in space exploration and fulfilled the goal set by President John F. Kennedy to land a man on the Moon and return him safely to Earth.
